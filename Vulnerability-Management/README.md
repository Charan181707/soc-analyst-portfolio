# üîí Vulnerability Management - Real-Time Analysis

## üß© Overview

This document showcases a real-world vulnerability management task using data collected from a Linux host (`Omsai_Desktop`). Each entry below highlights key vulnerability metadata, severity, and exploit details. As an SOC Analyst, understanding and organizing such data is essential for patch prioritization, threat mitigation, and escalation decisions.

## üìå Sample Vulnerability Analysis

| Agent Name     | Package Name             | Version                   | CVE ID          | Severity | Description |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Omsai_Desktop  | passwd                   | 1:4.13+dfsg1-4ubuntu3.2   | CVE-2024-56433   | Low      | shadow-utils default `/etc/subuid` behavior may lead to UID conflicts and account takeover. |
| Omsai_Desktop  | sssd-krb5                | 2.9.4-1.1ubuntu6.2        | CVE-2023-3326    | Critical | pam_krb5 may trust forged Kerberos TGT responses without validation, allowing remote auth bypass. |
| Omsai_Desktop  | libpolkit-agent-1-0      | 124-2ubuntu1.24.04.2      | CVE-2016-2568    | High     | `pkexec` local user privilege escalation via crafted `ioctl` input. |
| Omsai_Desktop  | xserver-xorg-legacy      | 2:21.1.12-1ubuntu1.2      | CVE-2023-5574    | Medium   | Use-after-free in Xvfb during legacy screen configuration may cause DoS or privilege escalation. |
| Omsai_Desktop  | linux-image-6.11.0-26-generic | 6.11.0-26.26~24.04.1 | CVE-2025-40364, CVE-2025-40325, CVE-2025-40114, etc. | Varies   | Various kernel-level vulnerabilities resolved, ranging from out-of-bounds access to improper memory handling. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- **Wazuh** for vulnerability detection and alerting.
- **Log Parsing & Normalization** via Wazuh rules and syscheck modules.
- **Manual CVE correlation** using NVD and vendor advisories.
- **Patch analysis** to determine fixed vs. vulnerable package versions.
- **Risk Classification** based on CVSS and asset exposure.

## üß† Key Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience identifying kernel-level and authentication-related vulnerabilities.
- Analyzed CVEs for severity, exploitability, and impact.
- Practiced triaging vulnerabilities for remediation or escalation.
- Demonstrated ability to report and communicate findings clearly and effectively.
